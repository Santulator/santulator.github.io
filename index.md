Santulator helps you run your Secret Santa draw simply and flexibly.  You can enter the names of the people participating in the draw and the system will randomly choose who will give presents to whom.  If you want to avoid certainly parings, for example to ensure that people don't get their own partners in the draw, you can add exclusions.  When the draw is run, a PDF will be generated for each person telling them who to buy a present for.  If you want to avoid accidentally seeing all of the results, you can add a secret password to the generated PDF files.
